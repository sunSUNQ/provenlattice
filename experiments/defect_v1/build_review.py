"""Build the stage 4 defect-candidate review sheet.

Stage 4's acceptance question is whether Event + sparse CFG is enough to
propose defects at all, and the only way to answer it is to look at the
candidates. This script turns a graph database into a deterministic, sampled
sheet of candidates with their evidence bundles and source text, and leaves the
verdicts blank. It never decides anything: precision comes from the human
annotations, and `--summarize` only does the arithmetic on them.

Two properties are load-bearing.

**Read-only, provably.** The database is opened through a `mode=ro` URI and the
semantic tables are read as raw rows, fed straight to `defect.py`. In
particular this does not go through `GraphQuery`: opening a `SQLiteStorage`
runs `executescript(SCHEMA)` and a backfill `INSERT`, which is correct for a
build but is a write, and a review package produced by a writer is a package
whose numbers cannot be reproduced from a frozen artifact.

**Deterministic.** Same database and same seed give a byte-identical JSON and
Markdown. Nothing here records a timestamp, a duration, or a path that varies
between machines; the sampling is a seeded shuffle over candidate ids, and the
strata are visited in sorted order.

    The key-to-query mapping is `defect.query_for`, so the matrix file stays
    the single source of truth for which query serves both keys. `all` is the
    three queries; a query name is itself; a matrix key filters its query's
    output, because one query can serve two keys (`resource_lifetime` is both
    4.1 and 4.6).

    Filtering *here* is safe because this script never truncates: it asks for
    `POPULATION_LIMIT` and filters what comes back. The query layer has to push
    the same filter inside itself, where truncation happens -- see
    `query.get_defect_candidates`.

    `identity=False` joins on the subject's spelling, which is stage 4's
    behaviour. It is what makes the four-column comparison readable: the same
    database read both ways separates the extraction changes from the identity
    changes, and on an old database it must reproduce the old sheet exactly.

    `limits` keeps two truncations apart, because they mean different things
    about the same stratum and one of them is not a population fact at all:

    - `recall_truncated` is the query's own flag, verbatim. Whatever caused it,
      candidates may be missing, so the population is a floor in that weaker
      sense. On a real repository the usual cause is `max_paths`: a leak whose
      first eight paths are all clean is not reported.
    - `population_capped` is this script's own cap, checked independently --
      the query returned already-capped output, so `population_N` is a floor
      *and* the sample is drawn from a sorted prefix of the population rather
      than from the population. That is a statement about the sheet's own
      sampling, and only it belongs on a stratum.
