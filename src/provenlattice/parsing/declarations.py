"""Lexical declaration index over one parsed file (stage 4.5).

Stage 4.5 gives every event subject a *declaration identity*: which object a
name refers to, where it lives and how long it lives. The graph has no
declaration table -- `nodes` holds functions, types and namespaces, and a local
variable has never been a symbol -- so the facts have to be read from the tree
at parse time, by the same parser that produced the events.

What the index answers, for one use of one name at one byte offset:

- **storage**: `local`, `parameter`, `function_static`, `field`, `file_static`,
  `global`, or nothing at all (a macro, an enum constant, a name declared in a
  header this file does not include). The last case is a real answer and not a
  failure: a cross-file global is the most important shared state a race query
  can see, and dropping it because this parser does not follow `#include` would
  be the one mistake that loses the finding.
- **type_token**: the declared type's last identifier, template arguments
  stripped. A token, not a type: it is enough to tell `std::mutex` from
  `std::weak_ptr`, which is what the LOCK receiver classification needs, and
  not enough to resolve anything.
- **scope_token**: the class a field belongs to, or the file a static lives in.
  Empty for a global -- a file-scope declaration without `static` has external
  linkage, so splitting it by file would invent two objects where the program
  has one.

Resolution is **position sensitive**: within a scope the last declaration
before the use wins, so `void f(int n) { { int n; use(n); } use(n); }` reads
two different objects. Scopes are searched innermost outwards -- blocks, then
the function (whose frame holds the parameters), then enclosing classes, then
the file -- which is also the order in which C++ shadows.
