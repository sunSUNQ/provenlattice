"""The sparse control-flow graph over semantic events (stage 3, appendix B.4).

Two halves share this module, and the split is deliberate:

* `SparseCfgBuilder` reads tree-sitter trees and produces one file's CFG as
  plain data (`models.ParsedCfg`). It runs at parse time, where the source
  bytes and the owner spans live, and never learns a repository id -- point
  identity travels as `models.PointKey`, which `graph.py` resolves against the
  events it published.
* `find_paths` and the three pattern functions answer reachability over
  published edges. They are pure functions over plain data, so tests can drive
  them without a database and the query layer stays a thin reader.

Neither half imports tree-sitter, so the module imports cleanly when the C
grammar is not installed.

What the graph compresses: a method's statements collapse to the events the
vocabulary produced plus three structurally-derived points (CHECK / BRANCH /
DEREFERENCE) and one synthetic exit per method. Straight-line code produces no
edges at all beyond the chain between its points -- that is what keeps the
graph sparse at million-line scale.

        axis, and it lives here where the walker already computes the

        Three rules; the third is what keeps the count honest:

        * **Write side.** This node is an assignment, a compound assignment, an
          update or an initializer: the object written is the outermost access
          expression inside its target field. `p->buf[i] = 5` writes one
          thing, not three.
        * **Read side.** Each named child that is itself an access expression
          is one read. The rule does not descend past it: `p->buf[i]`'s
          children are the same access spelled more finely, and the walker will
          reach them on its own (their DEREFERENCE points must not change).
        * **Skips.** The write target is not also a read; a declarator names an
          object being declared, not one being read; a callee is what is
          invoked, not a variable.

        Emission is filtered by storage class, and the filter is the identity
        rather than a heuristic -- see `ACCESS_STORAGES`. The subject comes

        other event's identity is measured with, which is also what keeps the

    Three keys are the reachability contract the pattern functions read --
    `event_type`, `subject`, `polarity` -- and they are all stage 3 ever put
    here. The rest are the defect layer's: `subject_from`, `subject_exact` and
    `raii` decide whether an identity is resolved or a name-level proxy,
    `thread_function` is what a spawn edge would point at, and the
    span/owner/file keys are what a candidate cites. Widening this dict is how
    stage 4 reads facts without a second query against the database.

    Stage 4.5 adds the declaration identity: `subject_decl` is the token that
    says *which* object a subject name refers to, `subject_storage` how long it
    lives, `subject_type` what it was declared as, `subject_member` the member
    path left over after the root name, `subject_site` the allocation site of an
    anonymous `new`, and `arguments` every root identifier passed to the call.
    A record without `subject_decl` is an old row or a name the file does not
    declare; the defect layer falls back to the name rather than dropping it.

      reachability for every other query in the same call.
