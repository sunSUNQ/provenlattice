#   READ / WRITE are level 1 by design -- they wait for the DFG (stage 5) and
#   are only extracted for symbols a defect rule has already flagged.
#
#   CHECK / BRANCH / DEREFERENCE stopped being "not yet extracted" in stage 3:
#   the sparse CFG walker produces them structurally (no keyword can name them,
#   which is exactly why they are not vocabulary events) and publishes them as
#   `matched_via="structural"` event rows.
#

#   OPEN / CLOSE / ACQUIRE / WAIT / SIGNAL / CREATE / DESTROY are level 1 by
#   omission. The design doc §23 lists them as node types, but the stage 2
#   level 0 list in appendix B.4 does not include them. Keeping them here means
#   a matrix entry that needs them -- 4.5 non-memory resource leak, graded A --
#   is reported as "requires an event we do not yet extract" instead of
#   silently looking supported.

# STRUCTURAL_EVENTS, and the split is load-bearing: the publication test pins
# `matched_via == "structural"` to membership in STRUCTURAL_EVENTS, and an
# access is published as `matched_via == "access"` -- it is a different kind of
# finding and the evidence bundle has to be able to say which one it is.
#
# They are also not vocabulary events in the way CHECK and DEREFERENCE are not:
# no keyword names a read, only position does, so the walker produces them from
# the assignment target it already computes. Unlike the structural three they
# are *published and never connected* -- see `_EDGELESS_EVENT_TYPES` in
# `sparsecfg.py` for why, and for what that protects.
